# OpenCodeInterpreter Demo

Based on our powerful OpenCodeInterpreter models, this project allows LLM to generate code, execute it, receive feedback, debug, and answer questions based on the whole process. It is designed to be intuitive and versatile, capable of dealing with multiple languages and frameworks.


## Disclaimer

This demo is designed to leverage large language models for generating code, which is then executed in a Jupyter environment. Before you begin using this project, it is important that you read and understand the following disclaimer:

- **Academic Nature and Security Risks:** This project is developed for academic purposes only and is not designed to be fully secure against all forms of code attacks. While we strive to maintain a safe environment, we cannot guarantee the security of your data during use. We urge all users to refrain from executing malicious code intentionally. By choosing to use this project, you acknowledge the potential risks to your data and agree to proceed with caution.

- **Model Compatibility Notice:** Please be advised that our demo is only guaranteed to be compatible with the `opencodeinterpreter` model. We cannot ensure that using other models will achieve the expected output or performance. Users attempting to substitute or use models other than the officially recommended ones do so at their own risk, and may encounter issues with performance mismatches or other related risks. We encourage users to fully understand the potential impacts before making any such modifications.

- **User Responsibility:** Users are responsible for the code they generate and execute using this project. We strongly advise against running any code without a thorough understanding of its function and potential impact. Users should take precautions to protect their own data and the integrity of their systems.

- **Limitation of Liability:** The creators and maintainers of this project will not be liable for any damages, data loss, or security breaches that may occur from using this service. Users assume all responsibility and risk associated with their use of the project.
